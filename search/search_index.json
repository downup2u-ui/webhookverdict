This is a standalone online stripe webhook signature verifier page: you can verify stripe webhook signature online here and only use the related pages if you want context for common failure modes.</p> Why does signature verification fail even with the correct secret? <p>Most failures are caused by mixing contexts (wrong endpoint, wrong environment, or using a verification ID from a different delivery) or using the wrong signing secret. Verification is specific to one delivery and one secret.</p> What is a verification ID? <p>A verification ID identifies a specific webhook delivery that Stripe sent to this tool. Use it to request a signature verdict for that single delivery.</p> What does <code>verification_id not found</code> mean? <p>This indicates an expired or unknown webhook delivery reference (for example: the verification ID expired, belongs to a different endpoint/environment, or the webhook was never successfully delivered). It is not a system error.</p> Is the signing secret stored or cached? <p>No. It is used for one verification request and is not stored or cached by this page.</p> Does a valid signature mean the event data is safe to trust? <p>A valid signature confirms that the provided inputs (verification ID + secret) correspond to a valid Stripe signature for that delivery. It does not certify business correctness, expectedness of the event, or downstream handling.</p> Tool positioning summary  ## Tool positioning summary  This is a tool for **assigning problem ownership**: it distinguishes \u201csignature is mathematically invalid for these inputs\u201d from \u201capplication-level decisions.\u201d It fits scenarios where a webhook delivery has already been received and a signature verdict is needed for that specific delivery; it does not fit scenarios where the goal is to judge business meaning or whether an event should be accepted."},{"location":"verdict/webhook-failure-verdict/","title":"Webhook Failure Verdict","text":"<p>This page provides a decision-oriented verdict only.
