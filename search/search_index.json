Most failures are not caused by Stripe sending an invalid request, but by **intermediate handling that changes the original request bytes**.  Common causes (facts only):  - **Raw body not preserved**: payload is reconstructed from a parsed object, re-stringified, trimmed, normalized, or has newline differences. - **JSON parsing happens before verification**: middleware consumes/decodes the body; the bytes used for verification are not identical. - **Wrong webhook secret**: secret from another endpoint, wrong environment (test vs live), or an outdated/rotated value. - **Wrong attempt/context**: mixing data across deliveries/environments/endpoints results in a failed verification."},{"location":"tools/stripe-webhook-signature-verifier/#compatible-with-stripe-webhook-signing","title":"Compatible with Stripe Webhook Signing","text":"<p>Compatibility notes: checks the <code>Stripe-Signature</code> header format, uses timestamp tolerance semantics, and matches Stripe\u2019s official signing algorithm for webhook signatures.</p>"},{"location":"tools/stripe-webhook-signature-verifier/#what-is-being-verified-and-what-is-not","title":"What is being verified (and what is not)","text":"<p>Verified: Given a <code>verification_id</code> (generated when Stripe delivers a webhook to this tool) and your <code>webhook signing secret</code> (<code>whsec_...</code>), the tool decides whether Stripe produced a valid signature for that specific delivery.</p> <p>Not verified:</p> <ul> <li>Business correctness</li> <li>Whether the event \u201cshould\u201d occur</li> <li>Whether application code is implemented correctly</li> </ul> <p>This is a one-time decision about signature validity only.

This is a standalone online stripe webhook signature verifier page: you can verify stripe webhook signature online here and only use the related pages if you want context for common failure modes.</p> Why does signature verification fail even with the correct secret? <p>Most failures are caused by mixing contexts (wrong endpoint, wrong environment, or using a verification ID from a different delivery) or using the wrong signing secret. Verification is specific to one delivery and one secret.</p> What is a verification ID? <p>A verification ID identifies a specific webhook delivery that Stripe sent to this tool. Use it to request a signature verdict for that single delivery.</p> What does <code>verification_id not found</code> mean? <p>This indicates an expired or unknown webhook delivery reference (for example: the verification ID expired, belongs to a different endpoint/environment, or the webhook was never successfully delivered). It is not a system error.</p> Is the signing secret stored or cached? <p>No. It is used for one verification request and is not stored or cached by this page.</p> Does a valid signature mean the event data is safe to trust? <p>A valid signature confirms that the provided inputs (verification ID + secret) correspond to a valid Stripe signature for that delivery.
